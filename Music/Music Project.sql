--Q1. Which tracks appeared in the most playlists? How many playlists did they appear in?

--Exploring the tracks table to get our bearings.
--3503 track ids, A few songs, like 2 Seconds to Midnight and 1Â° De Julho are in the tracks table multiple times with multiple trackid's.

SELECT name, trackid
FROM tracks
ORDER BY name asc;

--We join the tracks and playlist_track tables on TrackId
SELECT tracks.name, COUNT(*) AS "Track Count"
FROM playlist_track
INNER JOIN tracks 
	ON tracks.TrackId = playlist_track.TrackId
GROUP BY tracks.name
ORDER BY COUNT(tracks.name) DESC
LIMIT 20;
--If we are strictly talking about number of appearances of a Song/Track in playlists, 2 Minutes to Midnight is the winner
--However, this song has 5 separate TrackIDs and is in the music playlist multiple times.
--There would need to be some de-duplication first to find the true, unduplicated number of tracks in playlists.Name


--Q2. Which track generated the most revenue? Which album? Which genre?
--Which track generated the most revenue?

--What percent of total revenue does each country make up?

--Q5 Do longer or shorter length albums tend to generate more revenue?

--We create the temporary table AlbumTracks which contains a track count, album title, and albumId

--We then join the AlbumTracks table to the tracks table then invoice_items table to get Album sales
--Because of how the database is structured, we need to "jump" a few times using different keys to eventually
--join the albumid with the invoice table
SELECT

--A5 Generating the table above shows the list of albums by number of tracks sorted high to low. 
--A Pearson's R correlation was done to find whether the length of an album tends to generate more sales.
--Album Length and Sales were found to be strongly correlated r(304) = .81, P < .001

--Q6. Is the number of times a track appears in a playlist a good indicator of sales?

--A6. Generally, the lower the number of playlist appearances by a track, the higher the sales figures.

--Q7. How much revenue is generated each year, and what is its percent change from the previous year?

--We make a temp table with the current year, revenue for the year, 
--and the previous year to use for previous year revenue calculations

--We can do a table self join to have the previous and current year's revenue on the same line.
--Notice that we are joining on the CurrentYear and PreviousYear columns to force the revenue to show up "1 year late" on the results table. 
--There is no data for 2008 in the dataset which explains why there is no percent change between 2008 and 2009.
